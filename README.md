You never had a shitcoin? Don't worry, we got you!

With our [Shitcoin Factory](https://www.shitcoinfactory.com/) you can generate your own in under a minute.

## Code

This repository is an Angular frontend originally based on https://github.com/Minds/web3modal-angular, but it looks almost nothing alike anymore, because that version was pretty difficult to build on.

The underlying smart contracts can be found at https://github.com/kovrichard/shitcoin-factory.
